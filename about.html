    <main>
      <p>Student Attendance Ethiopia is a solution for teachers to register the absence of their students.
        The teacher will contact the students' guardians to gather this information.
        This will help understanding why students are absent from school, but also hopefully reduce absence from schools in Ethiopia.
        Both the length of and the reason for the absence will be tracked.
        The data will be collected in a national database and analyzed.
        There will be absence managers at school whose responsibility is to find out why students are absent if the teacher was unable to reach the students' guardians, 
        or if there is suspicion that they are not telling the truth.
        The absence manager will report back to the teacher.
